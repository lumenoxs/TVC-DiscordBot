# SMP Rules
## This is a true vanilla server with no plugins, addons, data-packs, or mods that directly affect gameplay.
### **Definitions**:
- **Spawn**: 2,500 blocks in any direction at any altitude from `0X, 0Z` in the overworld.
- **An ongoing fight**: Where a player has successfully hit another player in the past 2 minutes.
- **Illegal items**: Any item that are unobtainable in the vanilla survival game without using bugs, exploits or cheats (ex: spawn eggs)
### **Griefing**: 
Griefing is allowed in any shape or form, with one exception: you must not destroy spawn in a way that makes it unescapable for a new player with no items
### **Withers**: 
Any withers must not be spawned or found at spawn or at the main end island.
### **Dupes**: 
Duping is not allowed, excluding TNT, rails, carpet, tripwire, gravel & sand dupes. Please note the string dupe was patched in 1.21.2, and instead use a tripwire dupe (there are multiple at this point, just google it).
### **Lag**: 
Any machine, project, or farm which is causing or may cause lag will be asked to be removed.
### **Chat**: 
The discord rules apply to the chat, signs, named items, or any form of communication in the minecraft server.
### **Hacks**: 
No hacking is permitted in any way possible, unless conflicting with the "Dupes" rules.
### **Combat**:
You can not log out of an ongoing fight. You may also not use anchors or crystals in combat (usage for a trap is fine).
### **Illegal items**:
Being found using or possessing illegal items will result in an inventory wipe + 3 day ban.

# Further info on the rules
## 
### **"I didn't know that was a rule" is not an excuse** and will be treated the same as if you did know about the rule.
### **You are fully responsible for your account(s) and your IP/network you play on**. An account/network breaking the rules will still end up with a punishment, even if the action taken wasn't yours.
### The rules are to be treated as the **"minimum baseline"**. **Use common sense.**
### Any punishment, consequence or decision based on these rules is **fully up to the respective staff member.**
